# LoginDelay
> Prevents people from logging in the moment the server boots up

This adds a (configurable) delay and message to people connecting to your server immediatly after it boots up. This can prevent a bit of lag if people are a slighty _impatient_.

## Installation
Just grab the latest JAR from [the releases page](https://github.com/Rayzr522/LoginDelay/releases).

## Usage
Drag n' drop it into your plugins folder, configure, restart your server, configure it to your heart's content, and you're done!
